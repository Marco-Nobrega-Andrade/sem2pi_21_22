# US 015 - Center Coordinator: Export statistics. Export number of full vacinated users per day.

## 1. Requirements Engineering

### 1.1. User Story Description

* As an Center coordinator, I intend to check and export vacination statistics. I want to export, to a csv file, 
the total number of fully vaccinated users per day.

  ### 1.1.2 Primary Actor
  * Center Coordinator

  ### 1.1.3 Stakeholders and interests
  * Center Coordinator: Wants accurate statistics.
  * Center Coordinator: Wants correct information about users.

  ### 1.1.3 Preconditions
  * Center Coordinator is identified and authenticated.
### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications

**From the specifications document:**

>"The Center Coordinator wants to monitor the vaccination process, to see
statistics and charts, to evaluate the performance of the vaccination process, generate reports and
analyze data from other centers, including data from legacy systems."

#### From the client clarifications:


* Question: 
  * In this US should the Center Coordinator check and export the Vaccination Statistics of the Center where he/she works at or should just check and export the Vaccination Statistics of all centers?

* Answer: 
  * The center coordinator can only export statistics from the vaccination center that he coordinates.


* Question: 
  * 1-Should the user introduce the name of the file intended to export the vaccination statistics ? 
  * 2-Are the vaccination statistics refering only to the fully vaccinated users or refering to something more ?

* Answer:
  * 1- The user should introduce the name of the file. 
  * 2- Only to fully vaccinated users.


* Question: 
  * Is the exportation of the CSV file that contains the total number of fully vaccinated users per day, the only feature that needs to be implemented in code, for US15? 

* Answer: 
  * Yes.


* Question: 
  * 1- When exporting vaccination statistics,do we export the data from all days available in the system or does the center coordinator chooses the time interval? 
  * 2-Is there any kind of format our exported data should follow?


* Answer: 
  * 1- The user should define a time interval (two dates). 
  * 2- Data format: date; number of fully vaccinated user.

### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria

* Statistics refereing only fully vaccinated users.
* Data format: date; number of fully vaccinated user.

### 1.4. Found out Dependencies

*No dependencies found yet*

### 1.5 Input and Output Data

**Input Data**

* Typed data:
  * Inserts the path to the CSV file to export.
  * Inserts the time interval to get the fully vaccinated users.
  
**Output**
  * Informs operation success.

### 1.6. System Sequence Diagram (SSD)

*Insert here a SSD depicting the envisioned Actor-System interactions and throughout which data is inputted and outputted to fulfill the requirement. All interactions must be numbered.*

### 1.7 Other Relevant Remarks

*Use this section to capture other relevant information that is related with this US such as (i) special requirements ; (ii) data and/or technology variations; (iii) how often this US is held.*


## 2. OO Analysis

### 2.1. Relevant Domain Model Excerpt
*In this section, it is suggested to present an excerpt of the domain model that is seen as relevant to fulfill this requirement.*

### 2.2. Other Remarks

*Use this section to capture some aditional notes/remarks that must be taken into consideration into the design activity. In some case, it might be usefull to add other analysis artifacts (e.g. activity or state diagrams).*



## 3. Design - User Story Realization

### 3.1. Rationale

**The rationale grounds on the SSD interactions and the identified input/output data.**

| Interaction ID | Question: Which class is responsible for... | Answer  | Justification (with patterns)  |
|:-------------  |:--------------------- |:------------|:---------------------------- |
| Step 1 - Asks to export users fully vaccinated in time interval |				n/a			 |       ExportVaccinationStatisticsUI      | n/a|
| Step 2 - Requests the path to the file |	Obtaining the file to export | ExportVaccinationStatisticsUI  |IE: responsible for user interaction |
| Step 3 - Gives the path |	Give path to responsible classes |  ExportVaccinationStatisticsUI   | n/a |
| Step 4 - Requests time interval to export those users | Obtaining time interval | ExportVaccinationStatisticsUI  | IE: responsible for user interaction           |
| Step 5 - Gives time interval | Give the time interval to responsible classes | ExportVaccinationStatisticsUI  |           n/a           |
| Step 6 - Obtaining data requested | Obtaining the data requested | ExportVaccinationStatisticsController  |     Controller      |
| Step 7 - Operation Success | Informing operation success | ExportVaccinationStatisticsUI  |  IE: responsible for user interaction |

### Systematization ##

According to the taken rationale, the conceptual classes promoted to software classes are:

* Company
* Users

Other software classes (i.e. Pure Fabrication) identified:
* ExportVaccinationStatisticsUI
* ExportVaccinationStatisticsController

## 3.2. Sequence Diagram (SD)

*In this section, it is suggested to present an UML dynamic view stating the sequence of domain related software objects' interactions that allows to fulfill the requirement.*

![US015-SD](US015-SD.svg)

## 3.3. Class Diagram (CD)

*In this section, it is suggested to present an UML static view representing the main domain related software classes that are involved in fulfilling the requirement as well as and their relations, attributes and methods.*

# 4. Tests
*In this section, it is suggested to systematize how the tests were designed to allow a correct measurement of requirements fulfilling.*

**_DO NOT COPY ALL DEVELOPED TESTS HERE_**

**Test 1:** Check that it is not possible to create an instance of the Example class with null values.

	@Test(expected = IllegalArgumentException.class)
		public void ensureNullIsNotAllowed() {
		Exemplo instance = new Exemplo(null, null);
	}

*It is also recommended to organize this content by subsections.*

# 5. Construction (Implementation)

*In this section, it is suggested to provide, if necessary, some evidence that the construction/implementation is in accordance with the previously carried out design. Furthermore, it is recommeded to mention/describe the existence of other relevant (e.g. configuration) files and highlight relevant commits.*

*It is also recommended to organize this content by subsections.*


# 6. Integration and Demo

*In this section, it is suggested to describe the efforts made to integrate this functionality with the other features of the system.*


# 7. Observations

*In this section, it is suggested to present a critical perspective on the developed work, pointing, for example, to other alternatives and or future related work.*
