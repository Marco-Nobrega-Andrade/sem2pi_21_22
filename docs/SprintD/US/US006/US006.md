# US 004 - DGS wants to record daily the total number of people vaccinated in each vaccination center.

## 1. Requirements Engineering

### 1.1. User Story Description

*DGS wants to record daily the total number of people vaccinated in each vaccination center*.

  ### 1.1.2 Primary Actor
    * «automatic» Timer/Clock

  ### 1.1.3 Stakeholders and interests
    * DGS:wants to record daily the total nummber of people vaccinated in each vaccination center.

  ### 1.1.3 Preconditions
    * There needs to exist a time in the config file so the daily record can work.
  
### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications

From the client:
> **Question:** "In the acceptance criteria, "the algorithm should run automatically at a time defined in a configuration file and should register a date, the name of the vaccination center and the total number of vaccinated users." How it is supposed to register this information? Should it be recorded in a file (ex: txt,..) or recorded in the system (ex: in a store) ?"
> **Answer:** The data should be written to a CSV file (field delimiter should be a semicolon).
> **Question:** After asking you to be more clear with your answer to my previous questions, you said that we can either access directly the "vaccinations report" file or create the option for center coordinators and administrators to view it's content, is this correct?"
> **Answer:** You misunderstood, I didn't say that. The file should be available in the file system and anyone having access to the file system can read the file contents.
>**Question:** We would like to know which kind of user (Administrator, Nurse...) is supposed to have access to the file generated by the system.
> **Answer:** Someone from DGS.
> **Question:** "As per the acceptance criteria, can the job be deployed manualy by a specific actor like Receptionist, Administrator,...? Who does the initial configuration for the automatic job?"
> **Answer** The algorithm should run automatically at a time defined in a configuration file and should register the date, the name of the vaccination center and the total number of vaccinated users.

### Systematization ##

According to the taken rationale, the conceptual classes promoted to software classes are:


* User
* VaccineAdministration

Other software classes (i.e. Pure Fabrication) identified:

* Company
* DailyReportUI
* DailyReportController


## 3.2. Sequence Diagram (SD)

*In this section, it is suggested to present an UML dynamic view stating the sequence of domain related software objects' interactions that allows to fulfill the requirement.*

![US004-SD](US006_SD.svg)

## 3.3. Class Diagram (CD)

*In this section, it is suggested to present an UML static view representing the main domain related software classes that are involved in fulfilling the requirement as well as and their relations, attributes and methods.*

![US004-CD](US006_CD.svg)

# 4. Tests
*In this section, it is suggested to systematize how the tests were designed to allow a correct measurement of requirements fulfilling.*

**_DO NOT COPY ALL DEVELOPED TESTS HERE_**

**Test 1:** Checks If the program detects if there isn´t any centers or users in the system.


    @Test
    void createReport() {

        DailyReportController controller = new DailyReportController();
        Calendar today = Calendar.getInstance();
        today.set(Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY, 0);
        try {
            controller.createReport(today);
        } catch (ListIsEmptyException e) {
            assertNotNull(e);
        } catch (ClassNotFoundException e) {
            assertNull(e);
        } catch (InstantiationException e) {
            assertNull(e);
        } catch (IllegalAccessException e) {
            assertNull(e);
        }

    }


**Test 2:** Checks if the counting per center is correct
