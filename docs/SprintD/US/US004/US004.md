# US 004 - As a receptionist at a vaccination center, I want to register the arrival of a SNS user to take the vaccine.

## 1. Requirements Engineering

### 1.1. User Story Description

* As a receptionist at a vaccination center, I want to register the arrival of a SNS user to take the vaccine.

  ### 1.1.2 Primary Actor
    * Receptionist

  ### 1.1.3 Stakeholders and interests
    * Receptionist: Wants to register the arrival of a SNS user to take the vaccine.

  ### 1.1.3 Preconditions
    * Receptionist is identified and authenticated.
  
### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications

**From the specifications document:**

>"On the scheduled day and time, the SNS user should go to the vaccination center to get the vaccine.
When the SNS user arrives at the vaccination center, a receptionist registers the arrival of the user to
take the respective vaccine. The receptionist asks the SNS user for his/her SNS user number and
confirms that he/she has the vaccine scheduled for the that day and time. If the information is
correct, the receptionist acknowledges the system that the user is ready to take the vaccine. Then,
the receptionist should send the SNS user to a waiting room where (s)he should wait for his/her
time."

#### From the client clarifications:

From the document:
> “All those who wish to use the application must be authenticated with a password holding seven alphanumeric characters, including three capital letters and two digits.”

From the client:
> **Question:** "Regarding US04, the attribute "arrival time" should be considered to let the user enter the waiting room.
For example, a user that arrives 40 minutes after his appointment wont be allowed to enter the center, and another who only arrives 10 minutes late may proceed. If so, how much compensation time should we provide to the user."

> **Answer:** In this sprint we are not going to address the problem of delays. All arriving users are attended and registered by the receptionist.

>**Question:** "When the receptionist registers a SNSUser arrival, should we validate that the vaccination center where the SNS user arrives is the same as where the receptionist is currently working? If so, should we allocate receptionists to vaccination centers, i.e., ask the receptionist which vaccination center is she currently working at?"

> **Answer:**  To start using the application, the receptionist should first select the vaccination center where she is working. The receptionists register the arrival of a SNS user at the vaccination center where she is working.

>**Question:** "When the SNS user number is introduce by the receptionist and the system has no appointment for that SNS user number, how should the system proceed?"
> 
> **Answer:**  The application should present a message saying that the SNS user did not scheduled a vaccination.
> 
### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria

From the client

* **AC**"No duplicate entries should be possible for the same SNS user on the same day or vaccine period"*

From the document:

* **AC1:** The user must have an appointment.

### 1.4. Found out Dependencies

Depends from:
* Vaccine Schedule (US001/US002)
* Vaccination Center
* Vaccine Type

### 1.5 Input and Output Data

**Input Data**
* Selected data:
  * Selects the center

* Typed data:
  * SNS number, validation.
  
**Output**
  * Appointment Data
  * Operation success
  

### 1.6. System Sequence Diagram (SSD)

*Insert here a SSD depicting the envisioned Actor-System interactions and throughout which data is inputted and outputted to fulfill the requirement. All interactions must be numbered.*

### Systematization ##

According to the taken rationale, the conceptual classes promoted to software classes are:


* VaccinationCenter
* VaccineSchedule
* WaitingUserStore
* WaitingUser

Other software classes (i.e. Pure Fabrication) identified:

* Company
* RegisterTheArrivalUI
* RegisterTheArrivalController


## 3.2. Sequence Diagram (SD)

*In this section, it is suggested to present an UML dynamic view stating the sequence of domain related software objects' interactions that allows to fulfill the requirement.*

![US004-SD](US004_SD.svg)

## 3.3. Class Diagram (CD)

*In this section, it is suggested to present an UML static view representing the main domain related software classes that are involved in fulfilling the requirement as well as and their relations, attributes and methods.*

![US004-CD](US004_CD.svg)

# 4. Tests
*In this section, it is suggested to systematize how the tests were designed to allow a correct measurement of requirements fulfilling.*

**_DO NOT COPY ALL DEVELOPED TESTS HERE_**

**Test 1:** Checks that the program can detect if the appointment isn´t in the same day.
    
    @Test
    void checkWaitingList() throws ParseException {
        RegisterVaccinationCenterController registerVaccinationCenterController =new RegisterVaccinationCenterController();

        AuthFacade authFacade = new AuthFacade();
        store.addUser(user, authFacade);

        vaccineScheduleController.obtainVaccineType(0);
        vaccineScheduleController.obtainVaccinationCenter(0);

        vaccineScheduleController.createVaccineSchedule(123456789,dateSchedule,"16:00");

        ActorCenterController actorCenterController =new ActorCenterController();
        actorCenterController.selectCenter(0);

        } catch (NoScheduleAppointmentForSnsNumberException e) {
            assertNotNull(e);
        }
    }

**Test 2:** Checks that it isn't possible to register a User 2 times
    
    @Test
    void addWaitingList() throws ParseException {
        App app = App.getInstance();
        UserStore userStore = app.getCompany().getUserStore();

        registerVaccinationCenterController.saveVaccinationCenter();

        ActorCenterController actorCenterController =new ActorCenterController();
        actorCenterController.selectCenter(0);
        RegisterTheArrivalController registerTheArrivalController = new RegisterTheArrivalController();

        SimpleDateFormat df = new SimpleDateFormat("dd-MM-yyyy");
        String strBirthDate = "10-10-2003";
        Date dateBirth = df.parse(strBirthDate);
        userStore.addUser(userStore.createUser("Pessoa", "Female", dateBirth,"Rua dos Tordos, 8",932222333 ,"paulo@gmail.com", 123456789, 312312132), authFacade);
        try {
            registerTheArrivalController.addWaitingUser(123456789);
        } catch (UserIsAlreadyInTheWaitingListException e) {
            assertNull(e);
        }
        try {
