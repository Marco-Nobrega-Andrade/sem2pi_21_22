# US 013 - Administrator: Specify a new vaccine

## 1. Requirements Engineering

### 1.1. User Story Description


* As an administrator, I intend to specify a new vaccine and its administration process
 
  ### 1.1.2 Primary Actor
  * Administrator

  ### 1.1.3 Stakeholders and interests
  * Administrator: Wants to specify a new vaccine and its administration process.

  ### 1.1.3 Preconditions
  * Administrator is identified and authenticated.

### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications 

**From the specifications document:**

>"For instance, for the Covid-19 type, there is (i) the Pfizer vaccine, (ii) the Moderna vaccine, (iii) the Astra Zeneca vaccine, and so on."

>"The vaccine administration process comprises (i) one or more age groups (e.g.: 5 to 12 years old, 13 to 18 years  old, greater than 18 years old)"

>"Per age group, the doses to be administered (e.g.: 1, 2, 3)"

>"The vaccine dosage (e.g.: 30 ml)"

>"The time interval regarding the previously administered dose"

#### From the client clarifications:

> **Question:**
Dear client. When specifying a Vaccine and its Administration Process, are there any rules for the following attributes? 
> Name, 
> Id,
> Brand,
> Number of doses, 
> Dosage.
> 
>Best Regards

>
> **Answer:**
Dear student. During Sprint B I will not introduce attribute rules/formats other than the ones that I already introduced (in this forum or in the project description). Please study the concepts and define appropriate formats for the attributes. 
>
>Best regards, Carlos Ferreira

> **Question:**
Dear Client. 
> 
>[1] We would like to know if when specifying a new Vaccine and its Administration Process, should a list of the existing types of vaccines be displayed in order for him to choose one, or should he just input it? 
>
>[2]  Also, in the Vaccine Type what information should each type contain? 
> 
>Thank you for you time and attention in advance,

> **Answer:** Dear student,
> 
>1- If the information is available in the system, it is a good practice to present the information to the user and ask the user to select;
>
>2- I already answered this question.

-

> **Question:**
Dear Client,
>
>As to the interval between doses, what time format are we to use? (e.g. days, weeks, months)
>
>Thank you

> **Answer:** Dear student,
>
>Dear student,
>
>Number of days.
> 
>Best regards,

## 3. Design - User Story Realization 

### 3.1. Rationale

| Interaction ID | Question: Which class is responsible for... | Answer  | Justification (with patterns)  | 
|:-------------  |:--------------------- |:------------|:---------------------------- |
|        		 |Interacting with the actor?|SpecifyNewVaccineUI| IE: responsible for user interaction|
| 			  	 |Coordinating the US?|SpecifyNewVaccineController|Coordinates or controls the flow of the user scenario| 
| 			  	 |Knowing the user using the system?|Company|Company know user| 
| Step 1: Create a new vaccine	 |Instantiating a new vaccine?|Company|Creator: R1/2. VaccineStore contains NewVaccine class objects|
| Step 2: Request for selection of one Vaccine Type  |n/a|| |
| Step 3: Select Vaccine Type |...saving the inputted data?|Vaccine|	IE: The object in step 1 has its own data|
| Step 4: Request brand name |n/a|| |
| Step 5: Type requested brand name |...saving the inputted data?|Vaccine|	IE: The object in step 1 has its own data|
| Step 6: Request number of doses |n/a|| |
| Step 7: Type requested number of doses |...saving the inputted data?|Vaccine| IE: The object in step 1 has its own data|
| Step 8: Request number of different age groups |n/a|| |
| Step 9: Type requested number of different age groups  |...saving the inputted data?|Vaccine|	IE: The object in step 1 has its own data|
| Step 10: Request age group interval |n/a|| |
| Step 11: Type requested age group interval |Saving the input data?|Vaccine|IE: The object created in step 1 has its own data.|

### Systematization ##

According to the taken rationale, the conceptual classes promoted to software classes are: 

 * Company
 * Vaccine
 * VaccineStore

Other software classes (i.e. Pure Fabrication) identified: 
 * SpecifyNewVaccineUI  
 * SpecifyNewVaccineController

## 3.2. Sequence Diagram (SD)

*In this section, it is suggested to present an UML dynamic view stating the sequence of domain related software objects' interactions that allows to fulfill the requirement.* 

![US013_SD](US013_SD.svg)

## 3.3. Class Diagram (CD)

*In this section, it is suggested to present an UML static view representing the main domain related software classes that are involved in fulfilling the requirement as well as and their relations, attributes and methods.*

# 4. Tests
**Test 1:** Check that it is not possible to create an instance of the Vaccine class with the brand blank value. 

	@Test
    void ensureBrandIsNotBlank(){
        try {
            VaccineStore vaccineStore = new VaccineStore();
            VaccineTypeStore store = new VaccineTypeStore();
            VaccineType vaccineType= store.createVaccineType("12345","description","mrna");
            ArrayList<Integer> agegroup = new ArrayList<>(Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4));
            ArrayList<Integer> interval = new ArrayList<>(Arrays.asList(1));
            ArrayList<Double> dosage = new ArrayList<>(4);
            vaccineStore.createNewVaccine(vaccineType,"     ",2,agegroup,dosage,2,interval);
        }catch (IllegalArgumentException e){
            assertNotNull(e);
        }
    }

**Test 2:** Check that it is not possible to create an instance of the Vaccine class with a not correctly defined age group.

    @Test
    void ensureAgeGroupIsCorrectlyDefined() {
        try {
            VaccineStore vaccineStore = new VaccineStore();
            VaccineTypeStore store = new VaccineTypeStore();
            VaccineType vaccineType= store.createVaccineType("12345","description","mrna");
            ArrayList<Integer> agegroup = new ArrayList<>(Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3));
            ArrayList<Integer> interval = new ArrayList<>(Arrays.asList(1));
            ArrayList<Double> dosage = new ArrayList<>(4);
            vaccineStore.createNewVaccine(vaccineType,"pfizer",2,agegroup,dosage,2,interval);
        }catch (IllegalArgumentException e){
            assertNotNull(e);
        }
    }

**Test 3:** Check that it is not possible to create an instance of the Vaccine class with a number of doses smaller than one.


    @Test
    void ensureNumberOfDosesIsNotSmallerThanOne() {
        try {
            VaccineStore vaccineStore = new VaccineStore();
            VaccineTypeStore store = new VaccineTypeStore();
            VaccineType vaccineType= store.createVaccineType("12345","description","mrna");
            ArrayList<Integer> agegroup = new ArrayList<>(Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4));
            ArrayList<Integer> interval = new ArrayList<>(Arrays.asList(1));
            ArrayList<Double> dosage = new ArrayList<>(2);
            vaccineStore.createNewVaccine(vaccineType,"pfizer",2,agegroup,dosage,0,interval);
        }catch (IllegalArgumentException e){
            assertNotNull(e);
        }
    }
